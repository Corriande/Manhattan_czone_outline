Manhattan_czone_outline 1/7/2025 Gabriel del Valle

I made this repository for those requesting an outline of the Manhattan Congestion Zone as a shape file. 

The outline was generated as geojson geometry from an image using a custom script and then converted to a shapefile. Both geojson and shapefile are available here.

For more information on my work mapping the Manhattan Congestion Zone, check out my blogpost!
